            You will have shorthand to scoped selector like the q, or qAll functions. You will also be able to add a "data-page-member" attribute on
            DOM node to map those elements on your control instance.
            If this element is a control, you get the control mapped on your page instead of the element.
        </p>
        <p>Another custom attributes, "data-page-action", and "data-page-link" make elements interactive and for "data-page-action", map it to a function on your page, like this <button data-page-action="alertMe">click me</button></p>
        <p>You will also manage events and databindings with the EventTracker (injected in a property called eventTracker), and much more.</p>
        <p>The fragment mixin also expand page/fragment with custom steps that you could benefit from.</p>
