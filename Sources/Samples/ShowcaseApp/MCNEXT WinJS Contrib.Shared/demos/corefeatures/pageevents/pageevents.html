                    WinJS Contrib replaces WinJS page control by a smarter version. This new Page control is 100% compatible so you will not see any visible change
					by introducing WinJS Contrib.<br />
					This custom page adds some helpers, and tweak the lifecycle of the page. It adds a little more step in the lifecycle, and it makes it extensible.
                    The goal is to build pages in a more efficient manner, and have some mecanisms to synchronize the construction of the page and the controls it contains.
                    It helps building pages without having to rely on WinJS Scheduler or setImmediate, and enforce better time to screen or at lease, more structured code.

				<h2>page lifecycle</h2>
				<p>
					WinJS Page control are built with this sequence : load (load the fragment that correspond to the page url and associated resources), 
					init (page is initialized but has no content), render (render the fragment content to the page), process (process controls on the page), 
					ready (page is ready for action).<br />

					each step correspond to a function on the page object that you could override. Be careful though, "init" and "ready" are empty in the base page (your page can implement it safely), 
					but "render" and "process" actually do stuff. The page also has a "processed" step that is called just after process, and that is empty.
				</p>
				<p>
					WinJS Contrib page add some additionnal parts in this lifecycle. First, their is a "rendered" step that you could implement, that is called immediately after render.<br />
					The custom page also has a "pageLifeCycle" property. This object contains metadata about the lifecycle, and a collection of "Step" objects
					Corresponding to each steps. You could add function or promises on those objects, and they will be awaited before the page lifecycle goes on.
				</p>
                <p>
					This mecanism allow controls to be part of the page construction. This mecanism also allow to synchronize the construction of pages with nested fragments.
				</p>

				<h2>layout event broadcast</h2>
				<p>
					The custom page also introduce a virtual "layout" step in the lifecycle. The page can broadcast some of those events to all controls.<br />
					To received those events, controls must have the css class "mcn-layout-ctrl", and implement the step they need.<br />
					The step you can implement are pageLayout, pageReady, and updateLayout. It is really usefull when you have to implement controls with
					JavaScript layout, like canvas based charts, custom grids, ...
