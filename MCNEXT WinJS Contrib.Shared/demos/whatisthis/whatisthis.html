                            WinJS Contrib is a set of tools, helpers and controls to complement WinJS, and help you build native HTML5 applications for Windows 8, Windows Phone 8.1 and iOS and Android through Apache Cordova.

                            WinJS is a great framework for building your native applications, but it lacks some features that we find valuable for expressiveness or productivity.

                        <div class="feature big" data-weblink="https://github.com/gleborgne/winjscontrib">
                            This application will walk you through most features in the library.

                            Everything is not polished as it should be but we develop and use WinJS Contrib day to day in our applications for Windows, iOS, and Android.
