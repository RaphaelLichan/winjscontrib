WinJSContrib.SwipeSlide

Control for a sliding effect on swipe. It helps building navigation or custom controls behaving like a flipview. For now it works only for horizontal swipe/slide.

To use it, add a reference in your page or in default.html
<script src="/scripts/winjscontrib/winjscontrib.ui.swipeslide.js"></script>
