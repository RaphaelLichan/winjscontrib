WinJSContrib.Settings.About

This package add an about page accessible through the settings charms

The screen must be registered through the "settings" application event.
If you don't have one, add the following to your default.js 

app.addEventListener("settings", function (e) {
  e.detail.applicationcommands = {
    "aboutSettingsFlyout": { href: '/pages/settings/about/aboutPage.html', title: "About..." }
  };
  WinJS.UI.SettingsFlyout.populateSettings(e);        
});
